To transfer a domain to another provider, the order must be initiated at the new provider.

## Preparing

Before starting the project the owner must:

- remove transfer protection;
- make sure the property information is correct and visible in the `whois`[^1] ;
- recover the authorization code.

A transfer cannot take place within 60 days of its creation, or a previous transfer.
