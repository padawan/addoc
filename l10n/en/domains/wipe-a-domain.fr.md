Deleting a domain from the **Domains** tab, does not destroy it. It simply blocks its operation if it uses our DNS servers.

To seperate its domain name without difficulty, **just do not renew it**. When a domain is not renewed, it is automatically destroyed in the registry after [different phases](domains/deadlines) (different depending on the extension concerned).

However, if it is necessary to destroy it before its expiry date, contact our [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). We will have to send us the [early destruction form](https://docs.gandi.net/fr/_downloads/dca2f6eba070d55485434fceee4127f8/delete-fr-v5.pdf) with the mandatory identification pieces.
