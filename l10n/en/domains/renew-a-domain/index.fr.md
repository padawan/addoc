By default the automatic renewal will take place 45 days before expiration.

{{% notice warning %}}
Automatic domain renewal can only take place if the **prepaid account** has the balance to pay it OR a **credit card** or **bank account** is provided as an automatic payment. To set up the automatic service, go to the **Billing > Payment Methods** menu in your **Customer Area**.

### Bank account automatic

Automatic bank account settings are not taken into account without editing.

To avoid domain suspension before preceding consideration, a period of _15 days_ is therefore in place between the activation date of the automatic renewal and the domain expiration date. In other words, **if a domain expires within 15 days of activating the automatic renewal, you will have to renew it by yourself**. The system will not deal with this.
