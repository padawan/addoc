To ensure that you receive emails from specific addresses and domains, they can be entered in **Emails > Configuration**. The incoming antispam will no longer affect their emails.

Emails sent to these addresses will still be submitted to [anti-spam validation](e-mails/delivery#système-de-notation).

Whitelisted lists are set at account level. They will therefore be used by all email addresses of the account.
