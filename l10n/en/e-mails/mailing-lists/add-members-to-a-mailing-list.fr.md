To add members to a mailing list, you need to connect to the [Postorius management interface](https://mailman.alwaysdata.com/). Log in using an admin email address that you have set to [create your mailing list](create-a-mailing-list).

Once identified, go to the management section of the relevant mailing list by clicking on its name.

## Manual addition of members

To manually add members to the list, go to the **Group memberships → Mass Subscription** section.

Add email addresses to the input box, due to one email address per line. Accepted formats are indicated under the section.

Default email addresses:

- _preconfirmed_: Users will be automatically registered without confirmation from them.
- _preapproved_: modelers will not have to revalidate the subscription.

Addresses are not _preferred_ by default (they must prove that their address is correct by sending a message), you can disable this step by checking the associated checkbox.
