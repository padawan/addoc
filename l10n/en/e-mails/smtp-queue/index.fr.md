The **SMTP > Queue** menu on the server will show you pending emails (incoming and outgoing emails) and allow you:

- via magnifying_glass_tilted_right: - in front of the desired email:
  - to access the full message (and in particular its heading);
  - to access logs explaining the reason for the temporary block;
- force to send certain emails;
- remove from the email waiting list (which would be problematic in case of [sending spam](/e-mails/react-to-spam-mailing/)).
