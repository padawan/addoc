A migration is an attempt to have a technical feature of your account evolved. For example, a migration to a new version of MySQL.

Available migration appears in the **Advanced> Migrations** menu of [alwaysdata](https://admin.alwaysdata.com). New migrations are added regularly, and we notify our users by email to inform them.

Some migration is optional: we let you choose whether to do it or not. Other migrations are mandatory, so you have some time to do them. Once the deadline has been reached, migrations that have not been completed will be done automatically.
