Setting up a new server is **free** but other requests made by our system administrators are charged. Here's their amount:

| Detail       | Price (HT)[^1] |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| CPU Change   | 400 €          |
| Switch Disks | 400 €          |
| RAM change   | 200 €          |
| Add GPU      | 200 €          |
| Add discs    | 200 €          |

If several changes take place at the same time, each intervention is invoiced with a ceiling of 600€ excluding tax.

Contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/) for more information and schedule intervention.

Any cancellations cancelled within 24 hours of the intervention will be invoiced.

[^1]: For [Gold servers] (accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices#serveurs-gold-infogérés), the price of interventions is doubled. The ceiling is then 1200 € excl. VAT.
