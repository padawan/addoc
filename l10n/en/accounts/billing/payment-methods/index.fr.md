There are two different ways to pay alwaysdata bills.

## Prepayment account

At each billing, your alwaysdata prepaid account is debited from the amount due. You need to create this prepaid account in a way that covers your bits.

We offer these different methods:

- Bank card;
- PayPal;
- Bank transfer: Our bank account is indicated on our invoices. In the transfer description, you will have to specify your _customer number_ or _invoice number_ in the transfer comments.

Account feeds by _transfer_ will appear in your interface as they have been taken into account by our team. This may take several days.

### Credit cards accepted

Credit cards authorized by our payment provider are: CB, Visa and MasterCard.

## Automatic Preference

Enter your bank account or card details in your administration, **Billing > Payment Methods**.

This payment method will then be automatically deducted from the amount owed. You no longer have to worry about paying for your alwaysdata hosting.

When you activate the automatic payment on your bank account, give your bank a [Preference Authorization](http://static.alwaysdata.com/docs/Prelevement.png).

## Chorus Pro

Hosting invoices can be made available on the [Chorus Pro] portal (https://portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/).

To do so, enter your SIRET and service code in the **Billing > Payment Methods > Parameters** menu.

Invoices will then be automatically sent to Chorus Pro portal when they are issued.

If your administration requires the addition of a commitment number it will be requested in a second time at the invoice level.
