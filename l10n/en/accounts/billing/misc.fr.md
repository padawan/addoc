There is no installation fee but a minimum 3 months commitment will be required when purchasing a Deedie/Gold server. If you do not want this commitment, the server price will be increased by 20% in the first 3 months.

## Group Invoices

It is possible to choose the day of the billing month, more flexible and convenient when you have multiple subscriptions (hosting, IP address, etc.).

To do so, go to **Billing > Parameters > Billing Day**.

A _prorata bill_ (on each subscribed product) is managed when setting up this feature to align dates.

## Change Business Name

If an invoice has been issued you can _exceptionally_ contact the [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add) to reassign it.

## Open to find its customer number/alwaysdata RIB
