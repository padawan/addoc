You can change from _[pack](accounts/billing/public-cloud-prices)_ and _commitment period_. The invoice for the new subscription is published the next day and you will have 30 days to pay it.

In the following cases, contact the [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/):

- take [Private Cloud](accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices) (or change its configuration/commitment period);
- move accounts to a Private Cloud (and vice versa): accounts are "black drinks" that the support team can easily move from one server to another without touching its content;
- change commitment period of an IP subscription.

## Prorated Refund

A pro rata refund is automatically made to the _prepaid account_ :

- when going to a higher or lesser offer;
- when migrating accounts to Private Clouds.

This refund can be used for future invoices.

{{% notice note %}}
No refund is made when switching to the free pack - contact the [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/) to analyze your situation.
