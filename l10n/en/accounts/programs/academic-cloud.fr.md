This program gives trainers the opportunity to invite - via the **Profile > Academic Cloud** menu - their students to host their projects with the following benefits:

- each student will have their _own_ free account;
- instructor will have _technical permissions_ on all accounts of their students;
- Our security device will not block your IP if it detects many requests coming from the same origin (for example in a course given from the premises of a school).

To get more information, fill in your profile with your facility information and [open a ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). The program is free for public projects and through partnerships for private structures.

During the registration process, students can choose between multiple packs. To get free Academic Cloud, they must choose _Free_.

Once the training is complete, students can keep their accounts, remove [permissions](accounts/permissions) granted to the trainer, and possibly [change offer](accounts/billing/upgrade-your-plan).
