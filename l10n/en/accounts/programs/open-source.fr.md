A **[Small Pack](accounts/billing/public-cloud-prices)** is offered **free** to active free projects.

Our program aims to host _only_ the Open Source project site, i.e. the code period, documentation and/or a showcase site (presentation/demo/communication).

To be able to send us your project by contacting us by [email](mailto:community@alwaysdata.com) or by opening a [support ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/).
