An alwaysdata user, named **profile** is represented by an email address that is used to login to the [admin interface](https://admin.alwaysdata.com).

This one _can_ own **accounts** on our [Cloud Public](/accounts/billing/public-cloud-prices) as well as **[serveurs](/accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices)** on which they can create accounts. Each **account** is _isolated_ from each other.

On these **accounts**, it is possible to manage [domaines](/domains), host [email addresses](/e-mails), [website](/sites), [databases](/databases) or other applications.

It may also have **[permissions](accounts/permissions)** on other alwaysdata profiles.

Hosted email addresses are linked to domains. They are _always_ on the same count as the domain.

[site addresses](/sites/add-a-site/#adresses) _can_ also be linked to domains. If this is the case they can be:

- on the same account;
- on another alwaysdata profile account;
- [déléguées](/domains/delegate-a-subdomain) has an account of another alwaysdata profile.
