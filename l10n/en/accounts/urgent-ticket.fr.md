Opening an urgent ticket, reserved for users owning a Deedie/Gold server, triggers incoming support by an engineer (24/7).

If the ticket concerns a problem covered by our _service guarantee_, we will resolve it first. This does not result in any overlap for our customer.

However, if the problem is not our responsibility, the intervention will be invoiced _100 € HT_, without a quote: opening the ticket in emergency mode is valid for acceptance. However, we will try to help you solve the problem as far as possible.

## Problems covered by the service guarantee

In the vast majority of cases, our monitoring automatically detects the anomalies covered by the service guarantee. It is therefore not necessary to open a ticket, our team has already been alerted.

Examples (non-exhaustive list):

- a service administered by alwaysdata has ceased to work (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, SSH, etc.);
- changes made since the alwaysdata administration are not correctly taken into account.

## Problems NOT covered by service guarantee

Examples (non-exhaustive list):

- any problems that result from the user's incorrect use of the server;
- abnormal behavior of user apps;
- any performance issues not related to server or network malfunctioning;
- saturation of server resources by user apps;
- any network malfunction whose origin would not be the responsibility of alwaysdata;
- any general request for assistance.

External tools make it possible to check in real time the operation of certain services:

- [HTTP](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/)
- [ping](https://ping.eu/ping/)
- [DNS](https://www.dnswatch.info/)
