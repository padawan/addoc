It can happen that your profile is suspended (mention **Account suspended** on your site, blocking different FTP services, SQL, etc. and for several reasons.

## Inactivity

In the case of a **free account**, if you did not log in to your [administration interface](https://admin.alwaysdata.com) in the _X days_ then your profile will be automatically suspended. Simply connecting to the administration interface will lift this suspension and your site and your services will be immediately available.

Achievements:

- a profile with less than a year old must log in every 120 days;
- a profile created between 1 and 4 years must connect every 6 months;
- a profile with 4 years of age, 1 connection per year is required.

## Illegal Content

By registering on our site and creating a profile, you agree to strictly comply with the French regulations in terms of digital content. Among these activities, **any illegitimate use will result in the immeditate suspension of your account**. Some examples:

- sending spam;
- hosting of sites of hamec<unk> onnage (called phishing);
- hosting of counterfeit sites (dofus, Habbo, etc.);
- attempts to check external systems (hacking) from alwaysdata servers.

## Non-compliance with the Terms and Conditions

Failure to comply with our _CGV/GC_ may result in a suspension of your profile. For example, having more than one free account is not accepted. However, we accept a maximum of 2 free accounts if you have at least one paid account.

In this type of situation, a **alert** will be sent to you so that you can regenerate your situation.
