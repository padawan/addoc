Here is a - not exhaustive - ban list:

- use SSH servers to run bots and daemons;
- use account for:
  - make [phishing](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hame%C3%A7onnage);
  - send [spam](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam#Dans_l'Union_europ%C3%A9enne);
    - any message must be sent with the recipient's **explicit consent** (_opt-in_);
    - using a purchased list at a third party is therefore obsolete as spam;
    - [several questions to ask before going into emailing](e-mails/delivery#emailing).
  - any other illegal use.

For all these restrictions, we reserve the right to suspend and/or cancel the profile.

## Free account

Add to previous presentations:

- have **multiple free accounts** for the same person;
  - Be careful not to confuse account with functionality (websites, domains, email addresses, databases, etc.).
  - An account can host as many functionalities (for example, as many sites) as you want.
- use the free account to make _remote connections_ to a _database_;
- use the free account to host resource-consuming apps, including proxies or mass mail systems;
- use the free account for sites/email addresses for _lucrative purposes_. It is therefore not possible to host the website or emails of a commercial company, to place advertisements that could generate profits, to sell directly on its site or via emails a service or goods, etc.

{{% notice note %}}
Only the account `alwaysdata.net` address can be used for [creating _website_](/sites/add-a-site/) on the Free Pack. To use your own domain to host a website, it is therefore necessary to take a paid package.

However, you can use your domain to [host _email addresses_](/e-mails/create-an-e-mail-address/) or [create _DNS records_](/domains/add-dns/) on the Free Pack.

Your profile may also be automatically suspended after _[X days of inactivity](accounts/alerts-notifications#inactivité)_ on your admin interface.
