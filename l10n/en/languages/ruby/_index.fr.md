The operation of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Ruby under a Unix system (e.g. Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- [proposed versions](languages/ruby/configuration#versions-supportées) range from 1.8 to 3.4;
- the [environment configuration](languages/ruby/configuration#environnement) is very straightforward.

The [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) frameworks are part of our autoinstallable applications.
