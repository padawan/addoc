The operation of [Python](https://www.python.org) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Python under a Unix system (e.g. Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- [proposed versions](languages/python/configuration#versions-supportées) range from 2.4 to 3.14;
- the [environment configuration](languages/python/configuration#environnement) is very straightforward.

The [Django]frameworks (https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/) are part of our autoinstallable applications and many other applications are also compatible. For example, [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/), [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/), [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) or [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).
