The operation of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Rust on a Unix system (e.g. Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- Rust is a compile language that does not require interpreters to run programs, but the [version](languages/rust/configuration#version) 1.86 is available;
- [HTTP Deployment](languages/rust/configuration#déploiement-http) is simply done.

Our marketplace offers the installation of the [Rocket]framework (https://rocket.rs/) and many other applications are compatible with our servers.
