The operation of [Go](https://golang.org/) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Go on a Unix system (for example, Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- Go is a compile language that does not require interpreters to run programs, but the [version](languages/go/configuration#version) 1.22 is available;
- [HTTP Deployment](languages/go/configuration#déploiement-http) is simply done.

Our marketplace offers the installation of the [Macaron]framework (https://go-macaron.com/) and many other applications are compatible with our servers; e.g. [Beego](https://github.com/beego/beego), [Iris](https://iris-go.com/), [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) or [Revel](https://revel.github.io/).
