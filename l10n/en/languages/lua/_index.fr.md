The operation of [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Lua under a Unix system (for example, Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- [proposed versions](languages/lua/configuration#versions-supportées) range from 5.1 to 5.4;
- the [environment configuration](languages/lua/configuration#environnement) is simply done.

For example, the [Sailor]frameworks (https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor) and [Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/) are compatible with our architecture.
