The operation of [PHP](https://www.php.net) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using PHP under a Unix system (e.g. Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- [proposed versions](languages/php/configuration#versions-supportées) range from 4.4 to 8.5;
- it is all possible to [customize php.ini](languages/php/configuration#paramètres-phpini);
- PHP runs in _FastCGI_, behind [Apache](sites/configure-apache), so it is possible to create `.htaccess` files;
- it is possible to [install extensions](languages/php/extensions) (from PECL or other);
- it is possible to [install packages](languages/php/packages) (_Composer_, _PEAR_);
- it is possible to [install libraries](languages/php/libraries).

Our marketplace offers the installation of [CakePHP]frameworks (https://cakephp.org/), [Laminas](https://getlaminas.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [TNH](https://github.com/tnhfw/tnh-fw).
