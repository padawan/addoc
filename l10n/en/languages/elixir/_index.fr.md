The operation of[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) at alwaysdata is standard. If you are used to using Elixir on a Unix system (for example, Linux), you already know almost everything you need.

- [proposed versions](languages/elixir/configuration#versions-supportées) range from 1.13 to 1.18;
- the [environment configuration](languages/elixir/configuration#environnement) is simply done.

Our marketplace offers the installation of the \[Phoenix]framework (https\://www\.phoenixframework.org/)\[^1].

- [Resource API](https://api.alwaysdata.com/v1/environment/elixir/doc/)

[^1]: Phoenix 1.6 is not compatible with our infrastructure because it requires Elixir 1.12 depending on Erlang 22. This will be updated at the next [migration](advanced/migrations) of our software infrastructure.
