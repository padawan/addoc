We have always offered our users the possibility to be hosted for free, in order to respond for example to small needs, or simply to test our platform before committing to a subscription. This is an offer that we do not regret, but which has some quite obvious inconsistencies coming mainly from the abuse of improper users.

The restricted mode we have put in place (and hope to improve as it progress) should help to isolate legitimate (or trustworthy) users better and thus improve the performance of their hosted services, while further limiting the setbacks that could be caused by cumbersome neighbors (in Public Cloud, neighbors, there are many).

## Raise restricted mode

In order to show white leg and we temote your most honoured intentions, nothing easier. You must comply with one of the following two cases:

- filled in a credit card in your payment methods (even with a free account);
- did at least once on our platform.

It is as simple as this and we believe that it will allow us to filter a large majority of malicious users. So if you follow any of these screens, no restrictions will be applied to your profile.

## Restrictions

If no credit card is configured in your account and you have never set anything yet, the accounts you own on alwaysdata will be restricted technically.

This restriction is not blocking at all for the relevant account, but allows us to limit possible abuses. For example:

- HTTP: Processing may be a bit longer as requests will be filtered by a bit stricter reactions;
- emails: sending messages from our SMTP servers can also be limited in quantity and/or time.
