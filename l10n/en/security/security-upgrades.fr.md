The software is updated regularly, and even immeditated (< 24h) in case of a security vulnerability. Depending on the operation of all stable Linux distributions, **security patches are applied without changing the version number**.

This **can** therefore determine whether or not a vulnerability is corrected.

The main update of our operating systems is via a [automation tool](advanced/migrations) that allows to do so autonomously and flexibly per account.
