[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/fr/) is a certification authority offering simple management of free certificates. Proposed certificates are of type [Validation Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-validated_certificate) and are valid [90 days](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html).

To avoid duplicates, alwaysdata allows the management of Let's Encrypt certificates only for [wildcard certificates](security/ssl-tls/lets-encrypt#certificats-wildcard).

The _.alwaysdata.net_ addresses are managed by the wildcard certificate `*.alwaysdata.net` returned by default by servers.

## Certificates checked

alwaysdata automatically manages and renews a Let's Encrypt certificate for each address pointing to our servers and added in the **Web > Sites** section. Thus every site hosted on its servers manages the HTTPS protocol.

Certificate management is limited to 64 characters per full address.

### Frequent Issues

#### Certificate not managed

Creation of these certificates is **dependent on DNS propagation**: the address must point to alwaysdata servers (HTTP verification is performed). Once the address is added to **Web > Sites**, the system will attempt to manage its certificate every _30 minutes for 24 hours_. It then passes _once a day_.

As such, our system will not be able to manage Let's Encrypt certificates for addresses using an [proxy](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_inverse) from a third-party company in front of our servers.

{{% notice tip %}}
People adding addresses before changing DNS records can, once the DNS provider has changed, relaunch the collaboration by deleting the addresses of the site in **Web > Sites** and giving them a few seconds later. **`WARNING`** This action should only be performed **once**, too many attempts can block the process and managing the certificate for a week. [Contact support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add) if the first attempt is unsuccessful.

## Wildcard Certificates

When a domain uses our [DNS servers](remote-access/login-details), it is possible to manage a [wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate) - of the form `*. xample.org` - in **Advanced> SSL Certificates > Add SSL Certificate > Create wildcard Let's Encrypt**. This certificate will be automatically renewed by the system.

Wildcard certificates require DNS verification to be managed, if you need to manage a certificate for a subdomain (e.g. `*. oo.example.org`) contact alwaysdata support.

{{% notice note %}}
These wildcard certificates are not valid for "nus" domains - example.org.
