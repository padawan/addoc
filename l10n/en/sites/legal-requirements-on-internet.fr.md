In France, any website editor (physical or moral), whether personal or professional, must comply with a number of statutory requirements.

## Equals

The equal mentions must appear in a way that is clear on a website. They protect Internet users and allow them to identify and contact the editors of any website in order to enforce their rights.

### Legal entity

- its business name;
- its siege address;
- a phone number;
- the name of the publication manager.

**Physics** people should only provide information about the host. This information is usually available via the `whois` system.

The [Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy of June 2004](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005789847&dateTexte=20080724) (LCEN) plans to provide users with an easily identifiable and accessible page containing this information.

Publishers are held responsible for everything that is accessible on their site (including comments of all types that the publisher must have control and mode). These must set up a means (email address, contact form, etc. ) for visitors to report offensive or illegal content.

### Host

- its company name: SARL alwaysdata
- its address: 91 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoreté, 75008 Paris
- his phone number: +33 1 84 16 23 49

Example that could be placed on your site:

{{% notice %}}
Host : this site is hosted by the company limited [alwaysdata](https://www.alwaysdata.com), having its social seat at 91 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris (tel. +33 1 84 16 23 49).

## Personal data

If a site records personal data (name, date of birth, address, social security number, etc. on its members, it must _inform the people concerned when registering_ and must specify if these are optional or mandatory, as well as the hard retention of information. This does not normally apply to login data (IP address, time of connection, etc. as long as they are used only to make statistics and kept for a reasonable hardship.

The site must allow people to _modify their information_ (either via a dedicated interface or simply by email) and inform them of this right.

## CNIL Declaration

The declaration to the CNIL ([Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés](http://www.cnil.fr)) when a site records personal information about people is no longer mandatory since the [RGPD](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reglement-europeen-protection-donnees). Depending on your project, a [Data Protection Impact Analysis (ADI)](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/RGPD-analyse-impact-protection-des-donnees-pia) may be required.

## E-commerce

A business that does e-commerce (whether goods or services) must indicate, in addition to the standard mentions, if the _prices show_ are _taxes_ or _TTC_ and if the _shipping cost_ are included.

If the VAT is subject to VAT, its _intra-Community VAT number_ must be shown in a visible manner. In addition, it is up to the company to ensure that the online payment is secured.

Online commerce sites must make available _General Sales Conditions (GVC)_ in addition to the equal terms and conditions to make a certain number of specific information available to their merchant site activity: price display. delivery times, delivery conditions, compliance with the [Chatel Law](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000017785995&dateTexte=) in particular.
