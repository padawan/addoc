You may need to disable your site for maintenance or unavailability: this feature is not available in the admin interface. On the other hand, simple solutions to enable this exist:

- the creation of an index file (think renaming your application) indicating that the site is currently under maintenance or disabled. All you have to do is do the opposite when the site can be accessed again;
- {{< fig "images/admin-panel_delete-site.png" "Admin interface: remove a site" >}}
- if you are using a Wordres-like CMS application, Joomla (.etc) an option is usually available directly in their admin interface.
